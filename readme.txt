== Theme Notes ==

= Slider =

After the theme is installed the metabox "Slider Settings" will appear in the WordPress admin panel in the post editing section.
In this metabox you will see two input fields: text-field and checkbox. If you check the checkbox the featured image of this particular post will appear in the slider.
Every post (or page) has its own metabox, so if you go to another post (or page) and check the checkbox there the featured image of that post (or page) will be added to the slider as well, and the slider will have tow slides. You can get as many posts (or pages) to the slider as you want.
The slider itself is located on the frontpage and consists of three parts: title (title of post), image (featured image of post), description (short description typed into the text-field in the metabox "Slider Settings"). 

= Post Thumbnail Functionality =

To post thumbnails we recommend using the image with width equal to 503px.
